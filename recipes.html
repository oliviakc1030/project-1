        <h2 class="h2-title">How To Choose A Beginner's Recipe</h2>
            <p>Any recipe has the potential to be a beginner's recipe. However, when starting out try to think simple. If you have never made bread before maybe don't start off trying to make a baguette. Of course, you can do whatever you want. But, try building the from the basics. For example, a soda bread is the best recipe to start with if you have never baked bread. If you have never baked a cake think about the cake before thinking about decorations.</p>

                    <h3>Mary Berry's Scones</h3>
                        <p>These are the most fun to make. This is a great recipe I have made countless times and would recommend to any beginner baker. The trick with scones is not handle the dough too much. Also, do not be afraid to use your flour. I have provided a picture to the left to show what the scones should look like right before popping them in the oven. </p>

                    <h3>Paul Hollywood's Caremel Biscuit Bars</h3>
                        <p>These are a bit challenging to make. There are a lot of skills you have to master before attempting this recipe. For example, learning how to work with choclate. I would recommend, if you are a beginner, read through the recipe. Then, try some of skills required to complete it. Once, you have mastered these skills, make these. It is like eating a homemade TWIX&reg Bar.</p>

                    <p>I love baking during the holidays. Making tamales is my favorite part of the holidays. This may not be technically baking but I thought it was worth adding to this section.</p>
