                <p>During the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic I decided to learn a new skill. I had always wanted to learn how to bake. But, I was always super intimidated by everything to do with baking. After watching countless hours of The Great British Baking show, I mustered up the courage to bake my first cake from scratch. I put on my oven mitts and prepared for a show down with my brand new <i>Pretty In Pink</i>, KitchenAid&reg; stand mixer. To my surprise it was not a total disaster. I actually made an edible choclate cake. It was such a satisfying feeling I decided to branch out to make other delicious creations. Along the way I have had total fails and great successes. I have made edible creations, which I have shared with friends. I have also made disaster delectables made only for the bin. The best part of all I have learned to embrace my mistakes and continue baking.</p>
            
            <p>I am creating this blog to share my baking adventures and new recipies I have made. I may decided to throw in a baking tip or two I have learned along the way. I am by no means a expert. I am just a self-taught baking enthusiast who is dreams of one day wining Star Baker.</p>

                <p>The about me section would not be complete without a little bit about my puppy Buffy. She is a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel. She is the sweetest most perfect dog in all the land. She eats just about anything and will do just about anything for food. </p>

            <h2 class="h2-title">Why Should You Consider Baking?</h2>
                <p>Learning a new skill can be challenging and rewarding. Baking has always seemed like a mystery to me. However, once I got started and took that first step the mystery disappeared. It is so much fun to take a little time out of my day to focus on a new task and make somthing delicious.</p>
